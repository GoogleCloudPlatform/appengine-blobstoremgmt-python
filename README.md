# Google App Engine Blobstore Blob Management Tool

This tool provides a graphic user interface that can be used to manage
blobs stored in the Google App Engine
[Blobstore API](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/blobstore/).

**Note:** this library is written in Python, but because it is a stand-alone
service, it can be used on any App Engine application.
